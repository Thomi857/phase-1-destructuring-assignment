// 1. Use destructuring to assign appropriate variables based on the sounds animals make.


// 2. Bolt the horse wandered off, so just give us four animals, and let's name them bessie, dolly, babe, and little.

// Arrays

// 4. Use destructuring to assign appropriate variables using the color names.


// Destructuring colors
const [r, blue, green, yellow, orange, indgigo] = colors; // Leaving out indigo

// 5. Some people have a really hard time picking out indigo, so let's leave that one out, using the first letter of each color as the variable names.
const [red, b, g, y, o] = colors; // Leaving out indigo and violet

// 6. But wait! Indigo is now feeling *super* left out. Let's only assign indigo using indg. 

// const [r, b, g, y, o, indg] = colors; // Now we include indigo as indg

// Objects

// 7. Use destructuring to assign all variables using the keys as the variable names

// Destructuring the frog object
